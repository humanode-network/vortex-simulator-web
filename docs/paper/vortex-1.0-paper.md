"In the sciences, the authority of thousands of opinions is not worth as much as one tiny spark of reason in an individual man."

**- Galileo Galilei**

## **Synopsis**&#x20;

Vortex is the main governing body (GB) of Humanode. As stated in the Humanode whitepaper v0.9.5 in 4 years time after the mainnet launch all the authority of Humanode Core will be transferred to Vortex and dispersed among its governing entities. Vortex aims to be an egalitarian GB where the voting power is equally distributed among its participants. In contrast with many other chains that heavily rely on PoS or PoW in voting power distribution, Humanode is reliant on its cryptobiometric infrastructure to determine that its governors are living and unique human beings thus enabling equal power distribution among them.

# Basis of Vortex

Vortex is based on five major principles through which the main organizational branches are structured:

1. **Cognitocracy**&#x20;
2. **Meritocracy**&#x20;
3. **Local determinism**&#x20;
4. **Constant deterrence**
5. **Power detachment resilience**

**Cognitocracy** (from Latin verb _cognoscere_ ‘to know’ and from Ancient Greek _kratos_ 'rule') - a legislative model based on granting the voting rights only to those who are able to bring constructive and deployable innovation (Cognitocrats). It is a system that tries to concentrate decision-making capabilities in the hands of those who have proven to be professional and creative enough to receive the rights to vote on matters of a certain specialization. Throughout this paper words “Cognitocrat” and “Governor” are used interchangeably, as one can’t become a governor without being a cognitocrat.&#x20;

Vortex aims to be a cognitocratric meritocracy where merit of innovation and optimization is separately evaluated from the merit of functional work. Both cognitocracy and meritocracy aim to concentrate power in the hands of those who have proof of proficiency in a specialization. Vortex aims to take into account the quantitative and qualitative data of contribution of governors to the Humanode network, through various forms of Proof-of-Time and Proof-of-Devotion that will act as cornerstones of a governor's emancipation from the Nominee to the Citizen status.

Ideology is usually a system of ideas or ideals that aims to regulate the economy and political processes of human society through a certain prism of principles and instruments. Local determinism denies ideology, as ideology is more a means of gaining political power rather than a viable approach to good decision-making. Local determinism acknowledges that any field of expertise has a tremendous amount of details and intricacies and that solutions that actually work efficiently on the ground don't usually align with the ideology that governs it. As long as a solution works and does so efficiently it doesn’t matter which side of the political spectrum it might be associated with.

One of the underlying principles of Vortex is the principle of constant deterrence. As any governing system, Vortex is a dynamic one, where balances and narratives constantly shift. The game changes faster than any checks and balances structure can evolve to deter the constantly changing meta. The principle of constant deterrence implies that individuals that comprise the governing body must actively seek centralization threats and mitigate them, refrain from delegating their vote and maximize their direct participation in governing processes. To carry out this deterrence efficiently there must be a transparent way of telling in which state the governing body is. Vortex will present the governors with a dedicated app allowing them not only to participate in governance, but also to clearly see based on data what state the system is in. By combining it with the principle of an active quorum, where only those governors who are actively participating are counted in the quorum, we hypothetically get a dynamic, flexible, transparent and active system of constant deterrence that would be aimed to hold at bay any force such as populists, oligarchs, collusionist, etc that might be trying to centralize efforts of the system for their own personal advantage.&#x20;

Power detachment is a serious issue of most blockchain governing entities out there. The fact is that the real power is usually distributed among top validators, as an inherent principle from capital-based Sybil-resistant protocols, and core teams of projects, while governance is misrepresented by active community members and some stakeholders. In an effort to make governance seem egalitarian there are even cases where chains introduced 1 human = 1 vote chambers on top of the existing PoS but this led to even more misrepresentation. Humanode aims to minimize detachment by making sure that every node is an individual, by providing the underlying principle of equality of all the nodes in terms of validation power, by making sure that governors are only composed of Humanode validators and by maximizing validator participation in governance. The detachment will still be there as there is almost zero chance that all validators partake in the governance, so the amount of governors will be less than the amount of validators. At the same time it will not be a democratic facade, behind which top stakeholders and core team members can rule as they see fit due to real power being concentrated in their hands.

## Vortex structure&#x20;

Vortex consists of three major parts:&#x20;

1. **Proposal pools**
2. **Vortex**
3. **Formation**&#x20;

Proposal pools and voting chambers belong to the legislative branch. Formation belongs to the executive branch.

Vortex structure</strong></p></figcaption></figure></div>

## Vortex Roles&#x20;

Vortex consists of Human nodes, Delegators, and Governors-cognitocrats.

1. **Human node** — a person who has gone through proper biometric processing, participates in blockchain consensus and receives network transaction fees but does not participate in governance.
2. **Governor** — a human node who participates in voting procedures according to governing requirements. If governing requirements are not met, the protocol converts him back to a non-governing human node automatically.
3. **Delegator** — a Governor who decides to delegate his voting power to another Governor.

# Cognitocracy

There are several primary objectives of cognitocracy. First, it is to form an elitogenesis sequence where the elite of the society is formed through demonstrating creative brilliance that evolves into real-world benefits. Second, to create a just competitive ecosystem for specialists that would constantly drive creativity and innovation to higher levels. Third, to make sure that there is a separation of power based on proof of knowledge and specialization, rather than a popularity contest. Fourth, to foster a cooperative environment that drives optimization and creativity to its highest potential. Fifth, to create an evolving intellectual barrier for obtaining voting rights and legislative mandate.&#x20;

This will be an ongoing research for quite some time, so please consider everything laid out in this paper to be hypothetical and highly experimental as there is an absolute lack of any empirical evidence or data to back up most of the hypotheses. This paper will go through a tremendous update after a real-life cognitocratic system will have been built and functioned for quite some time to gather data. &#x20;

Delving into the philosophical base we can outline five major principles that molded into the approach behind the design of cognitocracy.&#x20;

1. Technocracy
2. Meritocracy
3. Intellectual qualifications for obtaining voting rights
4. Hybrid of direct and representative democracies&#x20;
5. Liquid democracy&#x20;

Undeniably technological development is one of the most influential processes that affects human species. Arguably, the most pivotal moments in our history were determined by our technological evolution. Technocracy implies that the decision-makers are selected based on their technological knowledge and technology-oriented methods of solving issues. It is often criticized for being elitist in nature as technocracy is closely associated with technological oligarchs that concentrate capital and emerging tech to get a grasp on the future development of their systems and thus have an undisputed rule over critical governing instruments or bodies. Cognitocracy inherits the principles of technological innovation and concentration of power in the hands of those who strive for innovation and technological development but puts aside the plutocratic trait of a common technocracy.&#x20;

Meritocracy has always been described as an ultimate form of governance. From Aristotle and Plato to Oliver Cromwell and Tomas Jefferson, hundreds of philosophers and key historical figures throughout history have claimed that merit must be the decisive factor in determining who is fit to rule. Unfortunately, as with any other idealistic philosophy, the world has never seen a real meritocracy in action. Favoritism, nepotism, blood-based capital inheritance and some other factors have been obstructing meritocracy from being enacted for a prolonged period of time. Cognitocracy cannot function without meritocracy. Cognitocracy derives from the very principle of merit but with a strong inclination towards creativity and innovation rather than functionality and working experience. The relationship between the two models isof the utmost importance for Humanode governance and will shape how the future governing apparatus is formed and is regulated.&#x20;

Introducing intellectual qualifications for obtaining voting rights has been a long-standing theme of debates all over the democratic world since the widespread adoption of democracy. There are two different cases here. First, the baseline intellectual tests for admittance of voters to broader elections. Second, the proof of expertise in a certain field to be eligible for a legislative position. The first case doesn’t concern cognitocracy, as there are no elections and no voting rights for those who haven’t proven their creative merit. The second one is where the challenge stands. Usually, this problem is addressed through obtaining diplomas in universities that satisfy unwritten requirements to enroll into a legislative body, but on paper not a single leading democracy of the modern world requires proof of one's intellectual capabilities in any form, while an overwhelming quantity of MP’s have some kind of higher education. Due to how most of the educational systems function, in today's world, ownership of a diploma of a higher education is in no way evidence of possession of innovative brilliance or decision-making capabilities which are necessary for effective legislature. Cognitocracy aims to establish intellectual barriers for obtaining voting rights in legislation with the difference that the test to understand one’s merit is conducted on the spot through proposals and not through a third-party institution of any kind. More about the enrollment procedure can be read below.&#x20;

Cognitocracy aims to maximize the direct participation of eligible voters in the governing process while acknowledging the delegation of vote as a necessary instrument to express political will without constant participation. Delegation is a critical variable, implementing a cognitocratic system without this instrument makes the system explicitly elitist. This question is addressed in more detail in a separate section below.&#x20;

In the case of cognitocracy, liquid democracy is applied to voice delegation, as there are no elections. Cognitocracts can only delegate their power to other cognitocrats. Such an approach makes the voting system more dynamic and reactive. The voice can be retracted at any given moment. Compared to elective mandate one's voice is not burnt away if their candidate loses the race. Utilization of liquid democracy brings other benefits such as reduced polarization as it allows voters to support representatives based on specific issues rather than aligning with a particular party or ideology. This can lead to more professional and issue-specific decision-making. The ability to change delegation at any time allows voters to respond dynamically to changing circumstances or evolving opinions. This adaptability ensures that representation remains aligned with the cognitocrats' current preferences.

Cognitocracy blends various underlying principles of the abovementioned postulates but puts the prevalence of an inventive, decisive, rational and intelligent mind above all else.&#x20;

## Chambers of Vortex

### Specialization Chambers

Cognitocracy functions through Specialization Chambers (SC) each representing a distinct field of expertise. These Chambers are governed by specialists - human nodes who had their innovative proposal accepted by a qualified majority of voters within a specific chamber. The fundamental principle of the Chambers is that only those who have convincingly demonstrated their creative merit to the majority of specialists in their respective field are granted the right to vote on matters related to that field. SCs aim to shard the legislative process to make it more professional and efficient giving the decision-making capabilities only to those who have undisputedly proven their intellectual properties to the majority of specialists.&#x20;

An egalitarian cognitocracy that follows the original postulates of Humanode would have a strict invariant of 1 governor-cognitocract = 1 vote so that scales of power remain balanced and so that the voting power is distributed and decentralized as much as possible. 1 human = 1 node = 1 cognitocrat = 1 vote.&#x20;

Let’s go over an example. Consider, for instance, the Programming chamber. While various subdivisions exist such as protocol, front-end, cryptobiometrics, etc., their consideration is presently omitted. To attain the status of a legitimate governor in the Programming chamber, one must present a proposal characterized by innovativeness, practicality, and realistic achievability for approval by the governors. The governors involved in the voting procedure have previously demonstrated their intellectual capabilities and field expertise through the approval of their own proposals and thus are cognitocrats. Consequently, only engineers with established specialization are granted the privilege to vote, thereby notably mitigating the probability of endorsing flawed or non-professional proposals.

This approach sets a system where only those Humanode validators who can pass the intellectual barrier get the right to vote and become governors, but at the same time all governors are always equal in terms of voting power.&#x20;

The design of the SC suggests that their main purposes are:

- Parallelisation of consensus without losing the quality of decision-making
- Egalitarian distribution of decision-making power among the cognitocrats
- Maintenance of an intellectual barrier for emancipation of voters&#x20;
- Dynamic distribution of vote delegation

This structure in some way might resemble ministries but has three major differences. First, usually ministries are a part of an executive branch while chambers are a legislative one. Second, ministries are formed from the outside, either a parliament or a president or a governing body sets their structure, while branches in cognitocracy are self-formed and self-regulated. Third, every ministry might have its own unique structure while chambers in cognitocracy maintain a uniform hierarchy structure.&#x20;

The voting thresholds for accepting a proposal will be set at a qualified majority of 66.6% + 1 vote. Meaning that 66.6% + 1 casted vote including delegated ones are in favor of a proposal. The quorum will be considered assembled if 33% of active governors of the chamber partake in the voting.&#x20;

The voting procedure, various thresholds and quorum mechanics are described in more detail below.&#x20;

Cognitocracy strives to be a dynamic system. With chambers arising only as a necessity to address a rising throughput of challenges and proposals from the same field. &#x20;

### General Chamber

Besides SCs there exists a General Chamber (GC) that incorporates all cognitocrat-governors that reside in a system regardless of their field of expertise. A GC acts as a venue for proposal submissions that affect a system as a whole. Any ruling of a GC is absolute and must surpass SCs in its legislative power as it would represent a democratic consensus of the whole system.

In rare cases, a GC can also be used as a method for forced admittance of a proposal to a SC. For example, if a SC proposal was locally declined several times then a proposer could submit it to a GC and if the cognitocrats vote to accept it then it will be enforced upon the SC and this proposer would still become a cognitocrat. The difficulty in this is that getting the quorum in a GC is much harder than in a SC and cognitocrats will be reluctant to contradict the opinion of experts in the respective SCs to enforce a proposal that was declined by the experts locally.&#x20;

### Chamber structure

Vortex uses a General Chamber (GC) and Specialization Chambers (SC). There are no sub-chambers.

### Chamber inception

SC creation follows the same steps as any other voting process - a proposal must be made and voted upon. There are several small differences though. First, only an established governor-cognitocrat can propose to form an SC. Second, a number of cognitocrats must be nominated to become the first cognitocrats in that chamber. Third, an approach to receive Cognitocratic Measure must be chosen. Read in detail below. After the chamber is created the newly established cognitocracts can admit new members as usual.

### Chamber dissolution

There are two ways to dissolve a chamber. First, through a proposal inside the SC. Second, through a proposal in the GC. Same as with inception, only cognitocrats can make such a proposal. The dissolution can be purely functional, when cognitocrats decide that an SC has become irrelevant, or it can be a vote of censure. If there is suspicion about a chamber being corrupt or some other malicious reason, a GC vote can decide to implement a motion of non-confidence.&#x20;

For all types of dissolution the procedure follows the guidelines of the ordinary voting procedure. With a small exception that during a GC vote of censure the cognitocrats who are a part of the targeted SC can’t partake in the voting and are not counted in the quorum.&#x20;

The penalties for residing in the dissolved SC are contextual and should take into consideration not only the properties of the system itself but also the actual case of why the chamber is dissolved.

### Proposal Pools

Proposal pools act as means to filter out crucial proposals and implement the quorum of attention. As mentioned before, every chamber has a proposal pool attached to it. The General Chamber also has its own proposal pool.

Proposals are submitted in a free form to the proposal pool of a respective SC. Active governors act as scouts that go through the submitted proposals and either upvote or downvote those proposals that they consider to be either useful or harmful. As soon as a proposal receives attention from 22% of active governors in a chamber, but not less than 10% of upvotes from governors, it gets propelled to a chamber where the voting procedure begins.&#x20;

Unless a proposal passes the necessary threshold to move onto the SC it remains in the proposal pool. The proposer is able to withdraw the proposal from the pool at any time, but receives a certain cooldown before being able to cast the same proposal once again. Every voting chamber is able to determine the cooldown necessary for various types of proposals submitted into its proposal pool.&#x20;

The biggest distinction between the Voting Chambers and the proposal pool is the fact that delegated votes are not counted in the proposal pool. Thus 22% quorum of attention casted would come from real human active governors only. Such an approach curtails the ability of popular governors with a big following and a lot of delegated voices to drive the narrative and the agenda of a chamber.&#x20;

Proposal pools act as drivers of the attention of the ecosystem participants. They allow for the community of governors to decide which proposals must be voted upon urgently and which proposals should be revised.

# Voting, Delegation and Quorum

### Quorum of attention

This quorum is applied in every proposal pool in the system. Proposals that receive upvotes or downvotes from 22% of active governors in a SC, but not less than 10% of upvotes, are immediately conveyed to a Chamber for voting.&#x20;

### Quorum of vote

This quorum is applied in the chambers. A quorum is reached if at least 33% of the Governors vote on a proposal. If 66.6% + 1 of the Governors, within the quorum, vote to approve a proposal, then Vortex will consider it approved. This means that 22% of the governors in the chamber will be the necessary minimum to approve a proposal. Human nodes that do not participate in governance are not counted in reaching a quorum. The voting power of each governor is equal to 1 + the votes of his Delegators.

Any proposal that is pulled out of the proposal pool gets a week to be voted upon in the respective chamber.

## Vote delegation and quorum

Cognitocratic vote delegation is one of the most controversial topics laid out in this paper as permittance of vote delegation opens up a pandora's box of power concentration behind an individual cognitocrat. Conditioning here is intertwined with how a system approaches to gather a quorum.&#x20;

If there is an absolute quorum where all the governing agents are considered during the count then not implementing a vote delegation entails risk of voters apathy - not being able to gather a necessary quorum to make any decision. On the other hand, if it is enabled then it makes the risk of centralization and corruption much higher as it is much easier to affect inert and apathetic voters to centralize around certain individuals. “Delegate and forget”.\
\
If there is an active quorum where only active governing members are included into the quorum count then not implementing the vote delegation makes the whole system very elitist as only those cognitocrats who have time and resources to dedicate themselves fully to governance will have the right to vote. In this case, it doesn’t even make sense to enable vote delegation only from active participants as if one is an active governor why delegate your vote in the first place if one is actively governing?&#x20;

The most interesting case, and the one Humanode is going to utilize, is counting only active governors in the quorum but allowing non-active cognitocracts to delegate their voice to any active cognitocrat. This type of a system tries to balance the elitism of cognitocrats with irrationality of a broader audience as delegation is allowed but only for those who have proven their merit. What is also unique about this delegation is that one can only delegate his voice to a fellow cognitocrat from the same chamber. Thus even delegation of voice becomes specialized.

### Veto rights

There should be a Veto system in place to prevent cases where the majority is wrong. This Veto should be temporary or still breakable with several attempts. It should be done so that there is no mechanism to stop the accepted democratic consensus, but slow one down to reconsider.

In Vortex the veto power is distributed among the cognitocrats with the highest Local Cognitocractic Measure (LCM) in their respective chambers. The LCM is described in more detail below. For example, if there are 12 specialized chambers the veto power would be distributed among 12 individuals who have obtained the highest LCM. If 66.6% + 1 person decides that some proposal should be vetoed, then the proposal will be sent back to vortex for two weeks. The temporary veto can be set twice. If the proposal gets approved for the third time then no veto can be implemented on it anymore.&#x20;

This Veto mechanism is a necessary tool of deterrence not only in the cases of minority vs majority, but also from direct attacks on a governing system from various vectors.&#x20;

### Voting procedure

Voting procedure</p></figcaption></figure>

# Cognitocratic measure

Cognitocratic measure (CM) is an attempt to objectify the contribution of each cognitocrat to the system as a whole. It’s a numerical score that is received by a cognitocrat every time a proposition is accepted by a chamber. Instead of just voting “Yes”, voters must also input a number (for the simplicity of the example let's assume that it is on a scale from 1 to 10). The average number that is derived from all the inputs converts into the CM received by the proposer. While CM tries to objectify contribution it is still a subjective measure that wouldn’t and shouldn’t in any way directly empower the mandate of any particular cognitocrat. Instead, it subjectively demonstrates to others the magnitude of contribution of a particular cognitocrat. It would be logical to state that the bigger the CM the more contribution was committed.

### Cognitocratic measure multiplier

As a cognitocratic system consists of multiple chambers depending on the specialization, cognitocractic measures received from different chambers can’t have the same value. A CM of 5 received in the Chambers of Consensus and Cryptobiometrics can’t be the same as a CM of 5 received in the chamber of Social Relations and Marketing. The relation between these two measures is severely contextual as a cognitocractic system can value Nuclear Physics more than Marketing or vice-versa. For this reason, a multiplier set for each chamber would help define the proportions between contributions to different chambers.&#x20;

**Local Cognitocractic Measure (LCM)** subjectively demonstrates the amount of contribution from a cognitocrat in a specific chamber.&#x20;

**Multiplied Cognitocratic Measure (MCM)** is LCM multiplied by the chamber multiplier.&#x20;

**Absolute Cognitocratic Measure (ACM)** represents the sum of all MCM’s received by a cognitocrat in various chambers.&#x20;

Absolute Cognitocratic Measure formula is as follows,

$$
ACM = \sum\_{i = 1}^{n}{LCM\_{Chamber(i)} \cdot M\_{Chamber(i)}}
$$

Where **i** is a specific chamber and **M** is a chamber’s multiplier.&#x20;

Let’s give a specific example.\
\
Bob has 5 LCM in a Philosophy SC and 10 LCM in SC of Finance.\
\
Multiplier for Philosophy SC is 3. Multiplier for Finance SC is 5.\
\
Thus,

$$
ACM = (3 \cdot 5) + (10 \cdot 5) = 65
$$

Bob’s ACM is equal to 65.&#x20;

### Setting the Multiplier

As CM plays an important role in projecting the contribution of a cognitocrat to other cognitocrats, the process of setting the multiplier for the chambers becomes crucial as it changes the balance of contribution projection. There could be various forms of such a procedure but as it was set in the beginning of this paper I will concentrate on describing the most egalitarian form conceivable.&#x20;

Every single cognitocrat can set a multiplicator on a scale from 1 to 100 for any chamber other than those where he received LCM. The average multiplier calculated from submissions becomes the Chamber Multiplier. In other words, it's the collective perception of the value brought to a system by a chamber that is represented by the average multiplier that is set by all cognitocrats but those who reside in the chamber itself.\
\
If a cognitocrat has received LCMs in multiple chambers then he is locked out from setting multipliers in all of those chambers.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/BvrzJv3eLe8wuaCcV7XmzeeOV2pmGGWiaNcBGyyx9H-PPKf5RawtH62ol5TnmBAu-lOF4VUnBvwZuEq-xtVGNUEclACVp6fwU0cB2gscZfyHsBGHTLIG3tTPKxAlpYb92Uty4oDcRiJDQogS_Q8Hc84" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 4. Setting the multiplier </p></figcaption></figure>

As can be seen on this Figure every cognitocrat sets a multiplier to every other SC they are not a part of. Eve and Mallory cast multipliers of 2 and 6 to SC1 which on average sets it to 4. Alice, Bob and Mallory cast multipliers of 2, 2 and 5 to SC2 which on average sets it to 3. Alice and Eve cast multipliers of 8 and 4 to SC3 which on average sets it to 6.&#x20;

### Cognitocratic measure in cases of SC inception or dissolution&#x20;

During an inception there are three outcomes that might be put in place by a proposer upon an approval of creation of a new SC :&#x20;

- A proposer (and nominees) receives ACM in a GC and both the proposer and nominees become cognitocrats in a created chamber. As in the case of any other proposition in a GC an average number submitted by approving cognitocrats becomes a CM received by the proposer.&#x20;
- A proposer (and nominees) receives LCM in the created SC with the difference that the number is aggregated from a GC vote.
- A proposer doesn’t receive any CM but still becomes a cognitocrat in a newly created SC.

Dissolution comes with a separate set of outcomes that are also very contextual. There are two major cases:

- Cognitocrats from a dissolved chamber retain their LCMs. Even if the SC doesn’t exist anymore the CM retains some legacy value that is either adjustable as others or frozen.&#x20;
- Cognitocrats from a dissolved chamber lose all of their CM associated with that certain SC. This case is highly associated with a vote of censure.

# Formation

Vortex governs the Humanode by deciding on key parameters through the voting power of human nodes. Formation is a part of the Humanode. It is a special grant-based development system providing grants, investments, service agreements, and projects to build. It is dedicated to supporting the Humanode network and all related technologies. It will be available for interaction through the Vortex DAO app.&#x20;

Any human node can join Formation to make a grant proposal or apply to become a part of a team that already develops an approved proposal. Proposals by non-human nodes can only reach Formation if one of the governing human nodes decides to nominate them. Such limitations allow us to protect devoted followers and contributors to the Humanode network.

Human nodes create proposals, allocate funds for their implementation that are sourced from the community and the treasury, and take coordinated action to see the proposals implemented properly. Governors upvote and downvote them. We assume that 2% of fees go to Formation as the network begins to function. Then, the proposers, i.e., Vortex, will regularly determine the percentage of the fees going to Formation.

It is worth noting that there is no need for participation in governance to partake in Formation. Any bioauthorized human node is allowed to join any project.

The Humanode network’s DAO supports a number of different proposal directions.

Generally, Formation funds:

- **Research:** Advancing basic and applied research in cryptobiometrics, cryptographic primitives, distributed systems, consensus mechanisms, smart-contract layers, biometric modalities, liveness detection, encrypted search, and matching operations.<br>
- **Development and Product:** Development turns research into software, while Product turns it into user experiences. Formation is primarily interested in technologies that expand the Humanode network, its potential, capabilities, and security, as well as the ecosystem, from decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens to decentralized courts.
- **Social Good & Community:** Formation supports community members to bring awareness to open-source, decentralized networks, and biometric technologies, and scale community outreach for the Humanode network. The Formation funds are mainly used to maintain the network.

### Assembling a team

We understand how crucial it is to find and coordinate people that are willing to support the

proliferation of the Humanode network. That is why we are developing a special team-assembly

procedure in the Vortex DAO app that will allow those whose proposals were approved by Vortex to find passionate professionals to assemble their team from the members of the international Humanode community. All the proposer has to do is send a digital offer to any other human node that he thinks is a good fit for his projects. Their proposal must have the public address of the potential member, and it should state working objectives and conditions and have a smart contract that locks some part of the grant for that person in particular and saves the data onchain.&#x20;

There can be:

- **Full team projects**, with predetermined participants;
- **The team is partially assembled**, with spots that can be filled later from the community;
- **No one in the team yet**, with all the slots available for the community.&#x20;

It is worth noting that there is no need for participation in governance to partake in Formation. Any bioauthorized human node is allowed to join any project.

<br>

# Conclusion

Vortex is a cognitocratic-meritocratic governing system with proposition rights emancipation based on various proofs of dedication towards the ecosystem. The parallelization of consensus through specialized chambers, that work through proposals voted upon only by proven specialists, is intertwined with the proposal right emancipation system that would allow gradual decentralization of power.&#x20;

The more actively governor-cognitocrats participate in the governance - the more robust, democratic and decentralized the chain becomes. Each and every human node is safeguarding the system from centralization and Sybils by maintaining cryptobiometric Sybil-defense. Only by active participation and direct expression of your will can the network become and remain decentralized. Potential governors must approach their duties with utmost efficiency and do everything in their capabilities to actively deter centralization efforts for personal or purely mercantile reasons.

# Discussion

### Gradual decentralization

Obviously, the Humanode network will rely heavily on the activity of its Governors. Besides building the technological solutions stated in this paper, the Humanode core will promote full transparency of governing processes and transactions, design and deploy decentralized governing processes, participate heavily in the Humanode community, and make development proposals. The Proposal Pool System/Vortex–Formation governance stack was designed by the Humanode core to create a hybrid Proof-of-Time/Proof-of-Devotion/Proof-of-Human-Existence safeguarded network. This implementation allows us to lower the influence of the problems that affect any system that tries to integrate democratic procedures:

1. Voter apathy is a very widespread problem that entangles every single voting system. The biggest part of this problem is the inability to reach a quorum. The Humanode network demands governance participation in proposals and voting from Governors and proof of existence from all human nodes. Those Governors who do not fulfill monthly governing conditions (either they did not make proposals or did not vote on any proposal) are automatically converted to non-governing. Quorum is reached if 33% of Governors vote upon a proposal, so it means that only voices of those who actively participate in governance are calculated to reach a quorum.
2. Masses are often mistaken. It is common sense that a small, dedicated group of professionals with years of experience would be able to give a more precise and correct opinion on a particular voting matter than a mass of people with different backgrounds and education. To balance the democratic approach with professional education and experience, Humanode core came up with a hybrid Proof-of-Time/Proof-of-Dedication governance system named “Vortex”, in which Governors have different tiers. They can be promoted in tiers if certain requirements are met. This way the protocol gives more tools and proposal rights to those who have more experience and have proven their devotion through Formation. The necessity to have your proposal approved before becoming a Governor acts as a Proof-of-Devotion step that uplifts the quality of Governors and acts as an important layer of defense against Sybil attacks.
3. Inability to directly delegate your vote to any other voter in a system creates many different forms of how the voting procedures take place. The very systems of how electoral delegates are chosen have loopholes that allow political tricks such as gerrymandering and filibustering. Governing human nodes are designed to be equal in voting power; at the same time, the voting mechanisms allow you to delegate your vote to any other human node without boundaries. A Governor’s voting power equals 1+ the number of delegations he has.

### The iron law of oligarchy&#x20;

“Who says organization, says oligarchy.”\
“Historical evolution mocks all the prophylactic measures that have been adopted for the prevention of oligarchy.”\
\
\&#xNAN;**_- Robert Michels_**&#x20;

This hypothesis was developed by the German sociologist Robert Michels in his 1911 book, ’Political Parties.’ It states that any organizational form inevitably leads to oligarchy as an ’iron law’. Michels researched the fact that large and complex organizations cannot function efficiently if they are governed through direct democracy. Because of this, power within such organizations is always delegated to a group of individuals.&#x20;

In Michels’s understanding, any organization eventually is run by a class of leaders regardless of their morals or political stance. Monarchies and republics, democracies and autocracies, political parties, labor unions, and corporations, etc. have a nobility class, administrators, executives, spokespersons, or political strategists. Michels stated that only rarely do representatives of these classes truly act as servants of the people. In most cases, people become pawns in never-ending games of power balancing, networking, and survival. Regardless of the inception principles, the ruling class will always emerge and in time it will inevitably grow to dominate the organization’s power structures. The consolidation of power occurs for many different reasons, but one of the most common ways is through controlling access to information.&#x20;

Michels argues that any decentralized attempts to verify the credibility of leadership are predetermined to fail, as power gives different tools to control and corrupt any process of verification. Many different mechanisms allow serious influence on the outcome of democratically made decisions like the media. Michels stated that the official goal of representative democracy of eliminating elite rule was impossible, that representative democracy is a facade legitimizing the rule of a particular elite, and that elite rule, which he refers to as oligarchy, is inevitable.&#x20;

This law is directly applied to modern elites. The financial network is always a complex multilayer construct that requires a great deal of administrative and organizational power. According to Michels, such a system would inevitably become oligarchic. While designing the basic principles of the Humanode network and Vortex, the Humanode core was faced with a challenge to find a delicate balance between organizational efficiency and the democratic involvement of the masses. We believe that a combination of voting power equality, unbiased intellectual barriers, direct delegation, Proof-Of-Time, Proof-of-Devotion, and proof-of-human existence would make a very balanced and just system, but it will not solve the problem of ‘Iron Oligarchy,’ as a leadership class will definitely emerge.&#x20;

Fiat credit-cycle systems have large financial entities, PoW networks are faced with miner cartels, PoS systems have validator oligopolies, and Humanode has Citizens and research groups. Governors have different proposal rights based on different tiers. Citizens have absolute freedom in proposal creation as they can put forth an idea of any type and some even wield a right to veto any decision that is approved by Vortex twice. Legate and Citizen freedom of authority is balanced out by the voting mechanism that requires a quorum and an absolute majority of those voting for a proposal to be approved. As the absolute majority of Governors is required for a decision to be approved, it negates the ability of Legates and Consuls to approve something against the will of the majority of voters.&#x20;

In a perfect world where all participants of the network actively govern, this balancing effort should be just enough to minimize the influence of any type of oligopoly that might emerge in the Humanode network, but we do not live in a perfect world. The apathy of voters is a scourge to most of the voting systems that exist and creates the necessity of vote delegation, which has its own advantages and disadvantages.&#x20;

### Vote delegation&#x20;

Problems of vote delegation have always accompanied any large democratic system. The core problem of democracies in their purest form is that they are very vulnerable to the Byzantine Generals Problem (BGP). Any system has a critical point of failure. Large systems tend to have several or dozens. Because of this, any democratic system requires institutions built on top to protect those critical points. These institutions limit the direct voting of the masses on crucial matters. There are four main reasons why these limitations are a necessity.&#x20;

1. Strategic resources, critical points, and stability. Any system has a sensitive part. For example, some countries wield nuclear arsenals and have democratic political systems. The vote on the deployment of nuclear weaponry is commonly restricted to a very small group of individuals. It makes sense that such an important spectrum would be heavily guarded against any angle of attack, especially the BGP. That is why this part of the system requires consolidation of power and an autocratic approach in decision making. Besides weapons of mass destruction, there are financial, energetic, military, trading, diplomatic, intelligence, etc. chokepoints that unless safeguarded can be used by the enemies of that system to cause catastrophic events and lead to destabilization. Natural autocracy rises in the chokepoints of strategic value.
2. Apathy of voters and effectiveness. Lack of caring among voters in voting procedures can lead to a halt in governance, as most voting requires some kind of a quorum. If apathy is strong enough to stop a quorum from being raised then the governance process stops until a quorum is reached. Some operations and decisions require the constant active involvement of voters, which is where delegation comes in hand. Ordinary people do not want or have time to participate in governance, which is why in representative democracies citizens can cast their vote to elect representatives that are actively involved in decision making. The fewer people participate in voting, the easier it is to coordinate.
3. Technological limitations. Before the digital era, there was no effective way to conduct voting procedures, as communications were not as developed as they are now. Without proper confirmation of identity and support of modern tech, it was hard to imagine a way to conduct large direct voting without putting strain on administrative resources. Delegating to a politically active person negates the necessity of using sophisticated technologies to conduct legislative procedures.
4. Misrepresentation. In most democracies your vote is restricted by the region you are geographically located in, meaning that you can cast a vote for a nominee tied to your constituency, but he might not get elected, meaning that your vote was practically burned and a person that you did not vote for might be representing you. Most governing systems lack the freedom of vote delegation, as you cannot directly delegate your voice to a particular person.&#x20;

While devising the voting procedures for Vortex, the Humanode core has kept in mind the principles mentioned above. The Governor tier system safeguards critical points by limiting the abilities of the electorate to create proposals but at the same time, the autocratic chokepoint is balanced out by requiring a quorum of Governors to approve created proposals. The influence of apathy of voters is limited by demanding voting activity from human nodes to be counted as Governors. This way only active participants of the network are counted in reaching a quorum. The technological progress in DAO deployment and biometric processing in the last decade has brought forward a way to overcome the obstacles of the past connected to direct voting procedures and the uniqueness of voters. Delegation of voting power is chamber-scoped: a governor can delegate their vote to another eligible governor within the same chamber. We acknowledge that even with modern approaches to voting and technological breakthroughs, a delegation mechanism in the Humanode network is a natural necessity.&#x20;

The digital revolution has paved the way for technologies that allow us to create systems with liquid representative democracies. Compared to traditional representative democracies, a voter can re-cast his vote any time he wants, without the necessity to wait for years to do it again. Vote delegation can be changed anytime. Delegated PoS (DPoS) protocols implemented liquid democracy for delegating transaction validation operations to professional entities. As the validators are safeguarding the protocol and receive a commission for their operation, the voter’s choice is usually driven by economic incentives: how the commission size, uptime, and security of the delegate’s server might reflect on the voter’s earnings. Is that enough to choose an opinion representative in a decentralized network? Most DPoS networks have a strict unbounding period that can last up to two weeks or even months. This measure is a necessity to safeguard the system from manipulated panic-based market crashes where Delegators undelegate their tokens and sell them in fear of losing value. In the Humanode network, voting power is not entangled with a token, which is why there is no need for unbounding periods. Any time a human node wishes to re-cast or simply retrace its delegation it can be done instantly.&#x20;

### Populist tide and professional backslide

It is commonly acknowledged that any voting system faces the problem of too much populism. Hypothetically there are two major approaches to how populism is perceived:&#x20;

- Populism poses a threat to democratic stability. According to recent studies, conducted by Jordan Kyle and Yascha Mounk of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, one of the key findings they have had is that populists are far more likely to damage democracy. Overall, 23 percent of populists cause significant democratic backsliding, compared with 6 percent of nonpopulist democratically elected leaders (J. Kyle & Y. Mounk, 2018). In other words, populist governments are about four times more likely than non-populist ones to harm democratic institutions.
- Populism is a necessary corrective mechanism that addresses popular problems and limits the power of elites.&#x20;

Regardless of which view is more accurate, populism is acknowledged to be a very powerful tool to gather the support of the masses in democratic systems. The main danger perceived by the Humanode core is the rise of populists. Individuals that know how to be popular do not necessarily have the intelligence, professional qualities, experience, or profound knowledge on the subjects they have to make decisions upon on a regular basis.&#x20;

In the Humanode network, every human node has a voting power of 1. Voting delegation in Humanode allows governors to delegate their voting power to another governor in the same chamber. Governor power equals 1+ the number of delegations from other governors. Such a system allows crowdsourcing possibilities as delegation is liquid and not regionally bound. As in any other democratic system, individuals that possess oratory, diplomatic skills and are backed by influential media sources have an advantage in the Humanode network. An introvert with sociopathic tendencies possessing a very professional skill set for decision-making operations will most likely receive less support than a good negotiator, orator, and crowd controller that possesses a mediocre skill set. This is slightly balanced out by the fact that human nodes must have an accepted proposal before they become Governors. Thus Governors should be less affected by populist media, as they have a confirmed intellectual skill set that allowed them to create a useful proposal accepted by the Governors of Humanode.

In Vortex voting procedures, Governors have disproportionate voting power and those Governors that have more delegations have more power. The professional backslide in our understanding poses a threat to the effectiveness, progressiveness, and constant optimization of governance. We fear that without Proof-of-Devotion, which is in a way a proof of having some kind of professional skill set, any democratic system faces becoming a plutocracy, where the wealthiest members control influential and credible media sources to direct the opinion of masses and drive support to candidates of their choosing.&#x20;

Proof-of-Devotion might bring a small balance to populism upheaval, as it demands participation in Formation to receive proposal rights on critical matters. Nevertheless, Consuls wielding huge delegations will inevitably emerge and their stance in decision-making mechanisms will be very strong. The only way to limit their influence is the direct and active participation of human nodes in governing processes. The more Governors that do not delegate their vote and actively participate in governance the less authority can be accumulated in the hands of those that seek it.

### Attack vectors on Cognitocratic core

#### Plutocracy

Plutocracy is a state of a governing system where most of the decision-making capabilities are affected or concentrated in the hands of large capital owners. The bigger the plutocratic effect on the system the more power and effort are diverted from continuous optimization, innovation and professional development to supporting and lobbying the interest of capital holders with an intention of maximizing profits through legislative interference.

Plutocracy is not rooted in any established political philosophy because every single political system on the planet is scourged by it. It’s less of a political system rather than a constant pressure from the elites whose power is derived from the wealth they own. Without transparency and proper deterrence any political system can become a plutocracy by being corrupted from the inside. Traditionally, the most vulnerable spot is elections. Political actors provide lobbying in exchange for electoral support and donations to a warchest. Little by little plutocrats infiltrate all branches of the government, including the legislative. In the end, instead of having a professional system “of the people, by the people, for the people” composed of specialists promoted based on their merit, modern political systems end up with political actors that struggle for power by pleasing their plutocratic overlords&#x20;

Cognitocracy is also vulnerable to plutocracy like any other system, but compared to other models it has some benefits that help to keep the plutocrats at bay and deter their influence.

- There are no elections in a cognitocracy. No position that is elected through a popularity contest. All Cognitocracts have the same voting power so there is no point of direct exchange of electoral support for lobbying.&#x20;
- If plutocrats want to help out a cognitocrat for him to lobby their interest in the future they have to divert resources to foster an actual creative innovation so that it is accepted by specialists. So instead of just spending capital on marketing.
- &#x20;Media campaign doesn’t play such a crucial role in voting in a cognitocracy. As a proposer is addressing a professional minority, it is more crucial to prepare and deliver a good paper than to have a massive public image. This is achievable without any external help, thus lowering the influence of plutocrats.&#x20;

#### Cognitocractic populism

Populism is a political approach that seeks to appeal to the interests and sentiments of the general population, often by presenting itself as a champion of the common people against a perceived elite or establishment. Notoriously, to gain power populists might support a popular resolution that satisfies the needs of the masses, but in reality is harmful and counterproductive.&#x20;

The very essence of cognitocracy addresses the issue of populism as its effects are limited by making sure that only specialists get to vote. It becomes way harder for populists to amass power as instead of appealing to the masses they would have to appeal to cognitocrats. Although one could argue that potential populists would still find a way by appealing to the most popular problems faced by cognitocrats.&#x20;

Promoting education and media literacy is the most long-term effective way of combating populist power grab. They both foster critical thinking, help potential voters distinguish between reliable and unreliable sources of information. Encourage fact-checking and critical evaluation of news and information.&#x20;

There is a hypothetical assumption (as there is no data yet) that a cognitocrat who was able to come up with a specialized creative innovation or optimization and was accepted by other cognitocrats will be less susceptible to false media pretenses and much more empirical in critical thinking than a broader population voter. An intellectual barrier that potential cognitocrats have to pass through also acts as an anti-populism barrier as, hypothetically, cognitocrats must personally reach some level of critical thinking and evaluation to actually come up with an innovation.&#x20;

#### Cognitocratic drain

Cognitocratic drain is a potential state in which a certain field has so much innovation and optimization implemented that it becomes very hard to come up with something creative to accept new cognitocrats. This state can lead to several critical changes that might affect the efficiency of a SC.&#x20;

It can lead to:

1. Lowering the barrier for admittance. Proposals become not as innovative or professional as they were before thus lowering the quality of cognitocrats admitted.
2. Emergence of innovative but non-practical proposals and their admittance.
3. Cartelization of a chamber without admittance of new cognitocrats and an emergent hierarchy.

If such tendencies arise in a SC it might be viable to either dissolve this chamber or merge it with another. This problem represents the very root of how cognitocracy functions. As mentioned above cognitocracy aims to be a dynamic system that creates and dissolves chambers according to the prevalent needs and throughput of proposals of a certain specialization. If the size of a chamber becomes disproportionately larger than the actual decision-making needs and potential innovation that this chamber might bring then it will inevitably fall into the state of cognitocratic drain which will certainly lead to above-mentioned consequences and pose a threat to a cognitocratic system as a whole.

# Meritocratic measure

Meritocratic Measure (MM) is an attempt to represent the merit of functional work and delivery in the Humanode ecosystem. While Cognitocratic Measure (CM) is received for having a proposal accepted in a chamber (i.e., demonstrating innovation and decision-making), MM is received through participation in Formation (i.e., executing work and delivering outcomes).

MM is a numerical score that is received by a contributor after completing a Formation task or milestone. After a delivery is submitted, governors (or reviewers designated by the relevant chamber) provide a rating on a scale (for the simplicity of the example, from 1 to 10). The average rating converts into MM received by the contributor.

MM does not grant extra voting power. It acts as a reputation and merit signal that helps:

- Demonstrate execution ability and reliability over time.
- Inform proposition rights emancipation (Proof-of-Devotion) alongside Proof-of-Time and Proof-of-Governance.
- Provide context in Invision insights when evaluating proposers and teams.

# Courts and disputes

Any governance system operating in an adversarial environment needs a structured way to handle disputes. Courts in Vortex exist to process conflicts, ambiguity, and suspected abuse in a transparent, procedural way, without reducing the entire system to informal social pressure.

Courts handle disputes such as:

- Delegation disputes and alleged delegation abuse.
- Milestone disputes in Formation (e.g., “delivered but not usable”, “unlock contested”).
- Identity integrity disputes (e.g., PoBU anomalies and suspected coordinated enrolment attempts).
- Governance process disputes (e.g., procedural issues, ambiguous rules, repeated abuse patterns).

Courts operate through cases with a clear lifecycle:

1. Case filing (reports + subject + trigger).
2. Evidence and proceedings (claims, evidence list, and planned actions).
3. A dedicated jury session and deliberation window.
4. A verdict and recommended actions (remediation steps, governance follow-ups, warnings, or escalation to a chamber proposal when needed).

Court outcomes must be auditable and should not silently mutate history. Court actions and verdicts should be recorded as events that can be reviewed later by governors and by the community.

<br>

# Invision

Invision is the reputation and system-state lens of Vortex. Its goal is to support the principle of constant deterrence by making the system measurable and legible: governors should be able to see what is happening, who is performing, where risks exist, and how governance is trending over time.

Invision provides an “Insight” layer that aggregates signals such as:

- Proposal history (submitted, accepted, rejected, abandoned).
- Delivery history (milestones completed, delays, contested milestones, returned budget).
- Governance participation (vote participation over time, comments and review activity).
- Delegation signals (delegations held, delegation changes, concentration indicators).

Invision is informational: it does not change the 1 human = 1 vote invariant. It exists to improve decision-making quality, reduce uncertainty, and help governors reason about trust, risk, and centralization pressure with concrete data rather than narratives alone.
