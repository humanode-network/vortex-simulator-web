Problem: Layout remains squashed/left-aligned across pages; Tailwind utilities aren’t applying as expected in dev.
Attempted fixes: degraded to Tailwind v3, upgraded to Tailwind v4/postcss; added custom utility fallbacks; adjusted app-shell/app-page sizing; checked Devtools (Style, Network, Elements), all in place, rewired components to canonical classes; generated Tailwind CSS manually; multiple hard-refresh/restart cycles.
Result: Still cucked.
Current state: repo reset to origin/master; layout problem persists; Tailwind utilities still missing/ineffective in the served CSS during dev.
