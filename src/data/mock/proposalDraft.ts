  summary:
    "Audit Vortex UX, create a lightweight design system, redesign key flows, and deliver dev-ready Figma + basic design tokens.",
  rationale:
    "Vortex has strong concepts but feels dense and unclear for many users, especially on mobile. A coherent design system + clear hierarchy reduces confusion and makes governance usable for new humans.",
  budgetScope:
    "Covers the UX audit + flow mapping, Design System v1 (tokens + components), redesigned core screens (proposals/chambers/Invision/proposal creation), and a dev-ready handoff bundle. Out of scope: implementing the redesign in the frontend.",
