              <p>
                <strong>Humanode</strong> is a network where identity is tied to
                a verified human. The core promise is simple:{" "}
                <em>one human = one node</em>.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>PoBU</strong> (Proof of Biometric Uniqueness) is the
                mechanism that makes that promise meaningful: it aims to ensure
                that one human cannot spawn many “governance identities” the way
                wallets can.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Vortex</strong> is a governance system built on top of
                that uniqueness. When the base unit is a human (not a wallet),
                governance can be designed around participation, competence, and
                accountability rather than wealth-weighted voting. In that sense
                Vortex is an evolution of governance: it tries to behave more
                like a <em>planetary system</em> with multiple balancing forces
                (legislative chambers, execution through Formation, courts for
                disputes, and feedback via Invision) instead of a single
                simplistic voting surface.

                Human Nodes is the “people layer”: search and inspect profiles,

                Factions are groups with goals, initiatives, and membership.
                They’re a coordination layer: not a chamber, not execution, but
                a place where aligned humans organize.

              <p>
                Invision is where governance becomes measurable: it summarizes
                behavior and delivery patterns into scannable insights (still a
                mock in this repo).
              </p>
              <p>
                In the app you’ll see “Invision insight” snippets attached to
                proposals. Conceptually, this is where a voter sees “track
                record” at a glance.

                Courts is the judicial layer. Cases are structured around a
                claim, evidence, and planned actions. The courtroom page is
                designed for reading, not scrolling through noise.

                The CM Panel is a specialized admin-style surface. In a real

                Vortexopedia is the glossary. Terms used across the UI should be
